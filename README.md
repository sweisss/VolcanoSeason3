# VolcanoSeason3

A convenient way to keep track of links to weather forecasts for frequently visited volcanoes and regions in the Pacific Northwest during "Volcano Season" (late Spring/early Summer). 

This app improves on [VolcanoSeason2](https://github.com/sweisss/VolcanoSeason2) by utilizing concepts such as Material Cards and Settings/Preference dialogs
as well as allowing the user to add, remove, and organize the list of forecast links.
